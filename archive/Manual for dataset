### **📌 Method 2: Mount Google Drive (Recommended for Large Files)**
If your dataset is large, it’s better to store it in **Google Drive** and access it in Colab.

#### **Steps to Mount Drive:**
1. **Upload the dataset** to your Google Drive.
2. In Google Colab, run the following command:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
3. Locate the file path and read the dataset:
