# AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System (P1)

## 🚀 Introduction
With the rapid growth of digital recruitment, manually screening resumes has become inefficient and time-consuming. Our **AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System** automates this process using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to ensure efficient, unbiased, and accurate candidate evaluation.

This project ranks resumes based on **TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity**, while a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier** categorizes resumes into relevant job roles. Recruiters receive a ranked list of the most suitable candidates, optimizing hiring decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview
### **🔹 Why this project?**
- **Manual resume screening is slow and biased** – AI minimizes human error and speeds up the process.
- **Keyword-based filtering lacks context** – Our system uses NLP techniques to analyze resumes accurately.
- **Recruiters often miss top candidates** – This tool ensures the best match between **job descriptions and resumes**.

### **🔹 How it Works**
1. **Resume Upload** – Users upload resumes in **PDF/DOCX** format.
2. **Text Extraction & Cleaning** – The system processes and extracts structured data.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Resumes are transformed into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**.
4. **Ranking Algorithm** – **Cosine Similarity** ranks resumes based on job relevance.
5. **Classification Model** – **KNN Classifier** assigns job roles based on skill-matching.
6. **Results Visualization** – Recruiters receive a **ranked list** and **heatmap visualization** for insights.
